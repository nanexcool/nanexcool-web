Hi Mariano,
I'm building a software developer talent network and I'm trying to figure out how to structure it so that it can be decentralized but I can still align incentives to provide a quality service for clients.
Is there any chance I could pick your brain to help design incentives?
I'm Argenitnean and I'm based in Buenos Aires.
This is my linked In (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianocolos/) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/lucianocolos).
I look forward to hearing from you.

Luciano
